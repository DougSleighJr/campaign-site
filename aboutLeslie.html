            <p>Hi, I'm Leslie Sleigh, and I want to serve the families in our community by sitting on the Shepherdsville City Council.
                I grew up on a ranch in a small town in south Alabama, and I was always interested in politics. 
                I wrote my Congressmen often, met two governors, and my mom would write me notes to skip school for political breakfasts.</p>

            <p>As I got older, I grew content to let the political world take of itself without my interest. My husband and I moved to Louisville, 
                and I happily tended to my career and family for over a decade without much interest in either national, state, or local government.</p>

            <p>Four years ago, we moved to Shepherdsville and now again live in a community much like my hometown. I love it here! I have missed the small-town feel,
                and I've enjoyed getting to know people here. Our community has a need for leaders who can work well alongside others even when they disagree.
                I enjoy helping people reach agreements and resolving conflict when it appears. I can lead a project from start to finish and enlist effective people
                who want to be involved.</p>

            <p>I once sat in a business seminar where the speaker said something I'll never forget. "Don't complain unless you have a solution to offer and 
                are willing to be part of the change." Our city may nut run like a business, but that principle has been key for me.
                I no longer want to watch the politics. I want to be involved on the inside.</p>

            <p>I am running for Shepherdsville City Council. I want to make our community stronger. If you live in Shepherdsville, 
                I would he honored to serve you, and I greatly value your support!</p>
