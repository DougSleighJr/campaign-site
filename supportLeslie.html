					<h3>Finance</h3>
					<p>Believe it or not, even running a small, local election costs more 
					than one might think. Every dollar donated to her campaign allows Leslie 
					to further reach the community. Every donation helps bring her closer to 
					serving the community.</p>

					<h3>Spread the Word</h3>
					<p>Throughout the campaign, Leslie will have flyers to distribute to local
					residents, and everyone can help with this! Do you have a business or live 
					on a busy street and want to display one of her yard signs? We can hook you up.</p>
