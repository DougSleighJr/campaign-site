# campaign-site

This will be the main site for my wife's next city council campaign. The goal is to provide a place for her to connect with people that want to support through various means. It will also provide more information on her goals and political views. <br>

There are no special requirements to view, simply download the project files and view the index.html in your browser of choice. <br>

User Experience - There are four different media queries built into the site to improve user experience.<br>

Comments - All files utilize comments throughout in order to break down the purpose.<br>

JavaScript requirements are in the Script.js file.<br>
1) index.html page has a photo that cycles after a certain amount of time.<br>
2) supportLeslie.html has hidden text on photos that reveal after they are clicked on.<br>
3) supportLeslie.html has a jQuery modal in the button at the bottom.<br>
