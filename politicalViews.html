        <p>I think we should all have an interest in politics to some degree. Local politics
         determine how our community is run. If people care about what happens in their communities,
          they will care about who they vote into office. If we, as citizens,
        want to make a difference in our cities, states, and country, we would do
        well to be as respectfully involved as we can. For me, it was this knowledge
        that spurred me on toward politics as a teenager, and it is what drives my
        desire to be involved in our local politics now.</p>
        <p>How do we let our voices be heard? By voting. If you want your opion
        to count for something in your local government, be an active part of the
        election process. Attend City Council meetings to learn what they are voting
        on. Write or call your Congressmen and women about issues that are important
        to you. Own this privilege that we are so greatly fortunate to have!</p>
